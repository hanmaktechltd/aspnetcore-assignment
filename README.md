## General Information
- This is a Queue Management System. It can help to manage queues in a busy environment

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6)
- PostgreSQL & Npgsql 
- FastReport.Net
- Bootstrap

## Features Workings and About the project
The Queue Management system involve these parts: 

- A client/customer - this is the person to be queued.
- A service point - these are the various places that customers can be served
- A service provider - this is the person who queues the customers and assigns them the service points they should head to and also gives customers their queue numbers
- Admin - creates, edits, updates, deletes (configures) the service points and the service providers. The admin will also be able to see the total number of customers served among other analysis and print the report

Working of the system
- A client/customer clicks a button to be queued.
- The customer is then given a queue number and a default service point, before they are assigned a service point by the service provider.
- The service provider then assigns the correct service point
- The customer will then print the ticket.
